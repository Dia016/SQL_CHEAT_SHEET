Sub-queries and Nested Selects

Say you are asked to retrieve all employee records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
You might use the following query to do this.

SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE salary < AVG(salary);
However, this query will generate an error stating, "Illegal use of group function." Here, the group function is AVG and cannot be used directly in the condition since it has not been retrieved from the data. Therefore, the condition will use a sub-query to retrieve the average salary information to compare the existing salary. The modified query would become:

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY < (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES);

Now, consider executing a query that retrieves all employee records with EMP_ID, SALARY, and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row. For this, the maximum salary must be queried and used as one of the columns. This can be done using the query below.
SELECT EMP_ID, SALARY, (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES) AS MAX_SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEES;

Now, consider that you wish to extract the first and last names of the oldest employee. Since the oldest employee will be the one with the smallest date of birth, the query can be written as:
SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE B_DATE = (SELECT MIN(B_DATE) FROM EMPLOYEES);

Write a query to find the average salary of the five least-earning employees.

SELECT AVG(SALARY) 
FROM (SELECT SALARY 
      FROM EMPLOYEES 
      ORDER BY SALARY 
      LIMIT 5) AS SALARY_TABLE;

Write a query to find the records of employees older than the average age of all employees.

SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE YEAR(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE,B_DATE))) > 
    (SELECT AVG(YEAR(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE,B_DATE)))) 
    FROM EMPLOYEES);

From the Job_History table, display the list of Employee IDs, years of service, and average years of service for all entries.

SELECT EMPL_ID, YEAR(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, START_DATE))), 
    (SELECT AVG(YEAR(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, START_DATE)))) 
    FROM JOB_HISTORY)
FROM JOB_HISTORY;
