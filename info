A database is a repository of data that provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying the data.  

SQL is a language used to query or retrieve data from a relational database.  

The Relational Model is the most used data model for databases because it allows for data independence.  

The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each tuple or row, preventing duplication of data and providing a way of defining relationships between tables.  

SQL statements fall into two different categories: Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
