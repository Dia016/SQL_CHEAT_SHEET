SQL contains date, time, and time stamp types. 

In SQL, date has eight digits, time has six digits, time stamp has 20 digits, where XX represents month and ZZZZZZ represents micro seconds. 
Functions exist to extract the day, month, day of month, day of week, day of year, week, hour, minute, second. Let us look at some examples of queries for date and time functions. 
The day function can be used to extract the day portion from a date. Example, get the day portion for each sale date involving cat. Select day, rescue date from pet rescue where animal equals cat.
Date and time functions can be used in the where clause. Example, get the number of sales during the month of May, ie. for Month 5, select count from pet rescue where month rescue date equals five. 
You can also perform date or time arithmetic. Example, what date is it three days after each rescue date? Maybe you want to know this because the order needs to be processed within three days. 
Select date_add, rescue date interval, three day from pet rescue. Special registers, current time and current date are also available. Example, find how many days have passed since each rescue date till now. 
Select current date-rescue date from pet rescue. The result will be in years, months, days. Now you know that SQL contains date, time, and time stamp types. Date has eight digits, YYYMMDD, 
time has six digits, HHMMSS, time stamp has 20 digits,YYYYXXDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ where XX represents month and ZZZZZZ represents microseconds,
Functions exist to extract day, month, day of month day of week, day of year, week, hour, minute, second. Date and time functions can be used in the WHERE clause. 
The day function can be used to extract the day portion from a date.

Write a query that displays the rescue date.
For this query, we will use the function DAY(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be only the DAY part of the date in the column. The query for this question can be written as:

1
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
Copied!
In case the query was asking for MONTH of rescue, the query would change to:

1
SELECT MONTH(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
Copied!
In case the query was asking for YEAR of rescue, the query would change to:

1
SELECT YEAR(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
Copied!
Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrival. Write a query that displays the third day of each rescue.
For this query, we will use the function DATE_ADD(COLUMN_NAME, INTERVAL Number Date_element). 
Here, the quantity in Number and in Date_element will combine to form the interval to be added to the date in the column. 
For the given question, the query would be:

1
SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE
Copied!
If the question was to add 2 months to the date, the query would change to:

1
SELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 2 MONTH) FROM PETRESCUE
Copied!
Similarly, we can retrieve a date before the one given in the column by a given number using the function DATE_SUB. 
By modifying the same example, the following query would provide the date 3 days before the rescue.

1
SELECT DATE_SUB(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE
Copied!
Write a query that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued, for example, the difference between the current date and the rescue date.
For this query, we will use the function DATEDIFF(Date_1, Date_2). This function calculates the difference between the two given dates and gives the output in number of days. 
For the given question, the query would be:

1
SELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE
Copied!
CURRENT_DATE is also an inbuilt function that returns the present date as known to the server.

To present the output in a YYYY-MM-DD format, another function FROM_DAYS(number_of_days)can be used. 
This function takes a number of days and returns the required formatted output. The query above would thus be modified to

1
SELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE)) FROM PETRESCUE

Write a query that displays the average cost of rescuing a single dog. Note that the cost per dog would not be the same in different instances.
